# This file lists all the modules in our repository; it's used by scripts that
# have to perform operations for each module.
#
# Any line that doesn't begin with a '#' character and isn't empty is treated
# as a path relative to the top of the repository that has a module in it.
# The 'released' field specifies whether this is a module we release and tag (a
# module importable by users).
#
# Note: another file that lists all the modules in our repo is
# the VSCode workspace gocloud.code-workspace - for now it has to be updated
# manually whenever this file changes.
