build and use an existing tagged image instead.

Flags:
      --apply                whether to run "biome apply" before deploying (default true)
  -h, --help                 help for deploy
      --image [name][:tag]   Docker image to deploy in the form [name][:tag]; name defaults to image name from Dockerfile, tag defaults to latest; empty string builds a new image
      --verbose              true to print all output from Terraform during "biome apply"
