      created from multiple editions,\\r\\nall of which are in the Public Domain in
      the United States, unless a\\r\\ncopyright notice is included.  Therefore, we

      (one page)\\r\\n\\r\\nWe produce about two million dollars for each hour we
      work.  The\\r\\ntime it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours\\r\\nto
      get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright\\r\\nsearched
      and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This\\r\\nprojected audience
      is one hundred million readers.  If our value\\r\\nper text is nominally estimated
      at one dollar then we produce $2\\r\\nmillion dollars per hour this year as
      we release thirty-six text\\r\\nfiles per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999
      for a total of 2000+\\r\\nIf these reach just 10% of the computerized population,
      then the\\r\\ntotal should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe
      Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext\\r\\nFiles by December
      31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]\\r\\nThis is ten thousand titles
      each to one hundred million readers,\\r\\nwhich is only ~5% of the present number
      of computer users.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt our revised rates of production, we will reach
      only one-third\\r\\nof that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless
      we\\r\\nmanage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly\\r\\nfrom
      Michael Hart's salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an\\r\\nassortment
      of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few\\r\\nmore years, so we
      are looking for something to replace it, as we\\r\\ndon't want Project Gutenberg
      to be so dependent on one person.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe need your donations more than

      Director's Notes:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the notes below, and so you will
      *NOT* think all\\r\\nthe spelling errors introduced by the printers of the time
      have\\r\\nbeen corrected, here are the first few lines of Hamlet, as they\\r\\nare
      presented herein:\\r\\n\\r\\n  Barnardo. Who's there?\\r\\n  Fran. Nay answer
      me: Stand & vnfold\\r\\nyour selfe\\r\\n\\r\\n   Bar. Long liue the King\\r\\n\\r\\n***\\r\\n\\r\\nAs
      I understand it, the printers often ran out of certain words\\r\\nor letters
      they had often packed into a \\\"cliche\\\". . .this is the\\r\\noriginal meaning
      of the term cliche. . .and thus, being unwilling\\r\\nto unpack the cliches,
      and thus you will see some substitutions\\r\\nthat look very odd. . .such as
      the exchanges of u for v, v for u,\\r\\nabove. . .and you may wonder why they
      did it this way, presuming\\r\\nShakespeare did not actually write the play
      in this manner. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\nThe answer is that they MAY have packed \\\"liue\\\"
      into a cliche at a\\r\\ntime when they were out of \\\"v\\\"'s. . .possibly
      having used \\\"vv\\\" in\\r\\nplace of some \\\"w\\\"'s, etc.  This was a common
      practice of the day,\\r\\nas print was still quite expensive, and they didn't
      want to spend\\r\\nmore on a wider selection of characters than they had to.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou
      will find a lot of these kinds of \\\"errors\\\" in this text, as I\\r\\nhave
      mentioned in other times and places, many \\\"scholars\\\" have an\\r\\nextreme
      attachment to these errors, and many have accorded them a\\r\\nvery high place
      in the \\\"canon\\\" of Shakespeare.  My father read an\\r\\nassortment of these
      made available to him by Cambridge University\\r\\nin England for several months
      in a glass room constructed for the\\r\\npurpose.  To the best of my knowledge
      he read ALL those available\\r\\n. . .in great detail. . .and determined from
      the various changes,\\r\\nthat Shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly
      as many of a\\r\\nvariety of errors we credit him for, even though he was in/famous\\r\\nfor
      signing his name with several different spellings.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, please take
      this into account when reading the comments below\\r\\nmade by our volunteer
      who prepared this file:  you may see errors\\r\\nthat are \\\"not\\\" errors.
      . . .\\r\\n\\r\\nSo. . .with this caveat. . .we have NOT changed the canon errors,\\r\\nhere
      is the Project Gutenberg Etext of Shakespeare's The Tragedie\\r\\nof Macbeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nMichael

      Notes: What this is and isn't.  This was taken from\\r\\na copy of Shakespeare's
      first folio and it is as close as I can\\r\\ncome in ASCII to the printed text.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe
      elongated S's have been changed to small s's and the\\r\\nconjoined ae have
      been changed to ae.  I have left the spelling,\\r\\npunctuation, capitalization
      as close as possible to the\\r\\nprinted text.  I have corrected some spelling
      mistakes (I have put\\r\\ntogether a spelling dictionary devised from the spellings
      of the\\r\\nGeneva Bible and Shakespeare's First Folio and have unified\\r\\nspellings
      according to this template), typo's and expanded\\r\\nabbreviations as I have
      come across them.  Everything within\\r\\nbrackets [] is what I have added.
      \ So if you don't like that\\r\\nyou can delete everything within the brackets
      if you want a\\r\\npurer Shakespeare.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother thing that you should
      be aware of is that there are textual\\r\\ndifferences between various copies
      of the first folio.  So there may\\r\\nbe differences (other than what I have
      mentioned above) between\\r\\nthis and other first folio editions.  This is
      due to the printer's\\r\\nhabit of setting the type and running off a number
      of copies and\\r\\nthen proofing the printed copy and correcting the type and
      then\\r\\ncontinuing the printing run.  The proof run wasn't thrown away but\\r\\nincorporated
      into the printed copies.  This is just the way it is.\\r\\nThe text I have used
      was a composite of more than 30 different\\r\\nFirst Folio editions' best pages.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf
      you find any scanning errors, out and out typos, punctuation\\r\\nerrors, or
      if you disagree with my spelling choices please feel\\r\\nfree to email me those
      errors.  I wish to make this the best\\r\\netext possible.  My email address
      for right now are haradda@aol.com\\r\\nand davidr@inconnect.com.  I hope that
      you enjoy this.\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid Reed\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tragedie of Macbeth\\r\\n\\r\\nActus

      looke not like th' Inhabitants o'th' Earth,\\r\\nAnd yet are on't? Liue you,

      Speakers, tell me more:\\r\\nBy Sinells death, I know I am Thane of Glamis,\\r\\nBut
      how, of Cawdor? the Thane of Cawdor liues\\r\\nA prosperous Gentleman: And to
      be King,\\r\\nStands not within the prospect of beleefe,\\r\\nNo more then to
      be Cawdor. Say from whence\\r\\nYou owe this strange Intelligence, or why\\r\\nVpon
      this blasted Heath you stop our way\\r\\nWith such Prophetique greeting?\\r\\nSpeake,
      I charge you.\\r\\n\\r\\nWitches vanish.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Banq. The Earth hath bubbles,

      as we doe speake about?\\r\\nOr haue we eaten on the insane Root,\\r\\nThat
      takes the Reason Prisoner?\\r\\n  Macb. Your Children shall be Kings\\r\\n\\r\\n

      Rosse and Angus.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rosse. The King hath happily receiu'd, Macbeth,\\r\\nThe
      newes of thy successe: and when he reades\\r\\nThy personall Venture in the
      Rebels sight,\\r\\nHis Wonders and his Prayses doe contend,\\r\\nWhich should
      be thine, or his: silenc'd with that,\\r\\nIn viewing o're the rest o'th' selfe-same
      day,\\r\\nHe findes thee in the stout Norweyan Rankes,\\r\\nNothing afeard of
      what thy selfe didst make\\r\\nStrange Images of death, as thick as Tale\\r\\nCan
      post with post, and euery one did beare\\r\\nThy prayses in his Kingdomes great

      he was combin'd with those of Norway,\\r\\nOr did lyne the Rebell with hidden
      helpe,\\r\\nAnd vantage; or that with both he labour'd\\r\\nIn his Countreyes

      a word, I pray you\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Two Truths are told,\\r\\nAs happy Prologues
      to the swelling Act\\r\\nOf the Imperiall Theame. I thanke you Gentlemen:\\r\\nThis
      supernaturall solliciting\\r\\nCannot be ill; cannot be good.\\r\\nIf ill? why
      hath it giuen me earnest of successe,\\r\\nCommencing in a Truth? I am Thane
      of Cawdor.\\r\\nIf good? why doe I yeeld to that suggestion,\\r\\nWhose horrid
      Image doth vnfixe my Heire,\\r\\nAnd make my seated Heart knock at my Ribbes,\\r\\nAgainst
      the vse of Nature? Present Feares\\r\\nAre lesse then horrible Imaginings:\\r\\nMy
      Thought, whose Murther yet is but fantasticall,\\r\\nShakes so my single state

      almost dead for breath, had scarcely more\\r\\nThen would make vp his Message\\r\\n\\r\\n

      \  Macb. My dearest Loue,\\r\\nDuncan comes here to Night\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lady.
      And when goes hence?\\r\\n  Macb. To morrow, as he purposes\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lady.
      O neuer,\\r\\nShall Sunne that Morrow see.\\r\\nYour Face, my Thane, is as a

      does approue,\\r\\nBy his loued Mansonry, that the Heauens breath\\r\\nSmells
      wooingly here: no Iutty frieze,\\r\\nButtrice, nor Coigne of Vantage, but this
      Bird\\r\\nHath made his pendant Bed, and procreant Cradle,\\r\\nWhere they must
      breed, and haunt: I haue obseru'd\\r\\nThe ayre is delicate.\\r\\nEnter Lady.\\r\\n\\r\\n
      \ King. See, see our honor'd Hostesse:\\r\\nThe Loue that followes vs, sometime
      is our trouble,\\r\\nWhich still we thanke as Loue. Herein I teach you,\\r\\nHow
      you shall bid God-eyld vs for your paines,\\r\\nAnd thanke vs for your trouble\\r\\n\\r\\n

      \  King. Where's the Thane of Cawdor?\\r\\nWe courst him at the heeles, and
      had a purpose\\r\\nTo be his Purueyor: But he rides well,\\r\\nAnd his great
      Loue (sharpe as his Spurre) hath holp him\\r\\nTo his home before vs: Faire

      quickly: If th' Assassination\\r\\nCould trammell vp the Consequence, and catch\\r\\nWith
      his surcease, Successe: that but this blow\\r\\nMight be the be all, and the
      end all. Heere,\\r\\nBut heere, vpon this Banke and Schoole of time,\\r\\nWee'ld

      that we but teach\\r\\nBloody Instructions, which being taught, returne\\r\\nTo
      plague th' Inuenter, this euen-handed Iustice\\r\\nCommends th' Ingredience
      of our poyson'd Challice\\r\\nTo our owne lips. Hee's heere in double trust;\\r\\nFirst,
      as I am his Kinsman, and his Subiect,\\r\\nStrong both against the Deed: Then,
      as his Host,\\r\\nWho should against his Murtherer shut the doore,\\r\\nNot
      beare the knife my selfe. Besides, this Duncane\\r\\nHath borne his Faculties
      so meeke; hath bin\\r\\nSo cleere in his great Office, that his Vertues\\r\\nWill
      pleade like Angels, Trumpet-tongu'd against\\r\\nThe deepe damnation of his
      taking off:\\r\\nAnd Pitty, like a naked New-borne-Babe,\\r\\nStriding the blast,
      or Heauens Cherubin, hors'd\\r\\nVpon the sightlesse Curriors of the Ayre,\\r\\nShall
      blow the horrid deed in euery eye,\\r\\nThat teares shall drowne the winde.

      you left the chamber?\\r\\n  Mac. Hath he ask'd for me?\\r\\n  La. Know you
      not, he ha's?\\r\\n  Mac. We will proceed no further in this Businesse:\\r\\nHe
      hath Honour'd me of late, and I haue bought\\r\\nGolden Opinions from all sorts
      of people,\\r\\nWhich would be worne now in their newest glosse,\\r\\nNot cast
      aside so soone\\r\\n\\r\\n   La. Was the hope drunke,\\r\\nWherein you drest
      your selfe? Hath it slept since?\\r\\nAnd wakes it now to looke so greene, and
      pale,\\r\\nAt what it did so freely? From this time,\\r\\nSuch I account thy
      loue. Art thou affear'd\\r\\nTo be the same in thine owne Act, and Valour,\\r\\nAs
      thou art in desire? Would'st thou haue that\\r\\nWhich thou esteem'st the Ornament
      of Life,\\r\\nAnd liue a Coward in thine owne Esteeme?\\r\\nLetting I dare not,
      wait vpon I would,\\r\\nLike the poore Cat i'th' Addage\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb.
      Prythee peace:\\r\\nI dare do all that may become a man,\\r\\nWho dares do more,
      is none\\r\\n\\r\\n   La. What Beast was't then\\r\\nThat made you breake this
      enterprize to me?\\r\\nWhen you durst do it, then you were a man:\\r\\nAnd to
      be more then what you were, you would\\r\\nBe so much more the man. Nor time,
      nor place\\r\\nDid then adhere, and yet you would make both:\\r\\nThey haue
      made themselues, and that their fitnesse now\\r\\nDo's vnmake you. I haue giuen
      Sucke, and know\\r\\nHow tender 'tis to loue the Babe that milkes me,\\r\\nI
      would, while it was smyling in my Face,\\r\\nHaue pluckt my Nipple from his
      Bonelesse Gummes,\\r\\nAnd dasht the Braines out, had I so sworne\\r\\nAs you
      haue done to this\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. If we should faile?\\r\\n  Lady. We faile?\\r\\nBut
      screw your courage to the sticking place,\\r\\nAnd wee'le not fayle: when Duncan
      is asleepe,\\r\\n(Whereto the rather shall his dayes hard Iourney\\r\\nSoundly
      inuite him) his two Chamberlaines\\r\\nWill I with Wine, and Wassell, so conuince,\\r\\nThat
      Memorie, the Warder of the Braine,\\r\\nShall be a Fume, and the Receit of Reason\\r\\nA

      What not put vpon\\r\\nHis spungie Officers? who shall beare the guilt\\r\\nOf

      we haue mark'd with blood those sleepie two\\r\\nOf his owne Chamber, and vs'd

      it other,\\r\\nAs we shall make our Griefes and Clamor rore,\\r\\nVpon his Death?\\r\\n
      \ Macb. I am settled, and bend vp\\r\\nEach corporall Agent to this terrible
      Feat.\\r\\nAway, and mock the time with fairest show,\\r\\nFalse Face must hide
      what the false Heart doth know.\\r\\n\\r\\nExeunt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nActus Secundus.

      'tis, it shall make Honor for you\\r\\n\\r\\n   Banq. So I lose none,\\r\\nIn
      seeking to augment it, but still keepe\\r\\nMy Bosome franchis'd, and Allegeance

      Get thee to bed.\\r\\nEnter.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs this a Dagger, which I see before

      not, and yet I see thee still.\\r\\nArt thou not fatall Vision, sensible\\r\\nTo
      feeling, as to sight? or art thou but\\r\\nA Dagger of the Minde, a false Creation,\\r\\nProceeding
      from the heat-oppressed Braine?\\r\\nI see thee yet, in forme as palpable,\\r\\nAs
      this which now I draw.\\r\\nThou marshall'st me the way that I was going,\\r\\nAnd
      such an Instrument I was to vse.\\r\\nMine Eyes are made the fooles o'th' other
      Sences,\\r\\nOr else worth all the rest: I see thee still;\\r\\nAnd on thy Blade,
      and Dudgeon, Gouts of Blood,\\r\\nWhich was not so before. There's no such thing:\\r\\nIt
      is the bloody Businesse, which informes\\r\\nThus to mine Eyes. Now o're the
      one halfe World\\r\\nNature seemes dead, and wicked Dreames abuse\\r\\nThe Curtain'd
      sleepe: Witchcraft celebrates\\r\\nPale Heccats Offrings: and wither'd Murther,\\r\\nAlarum'd
      by his Centinell, the Wolfe,\\r\\nWhose howle's his Watch, thus with his stealthy
      pace,\\r\\nWith Tarquins rauishing sides, towards his designe\\r\\nMoues like

      may walke, for feare\\r\\nThy very stones prate of my where-about,\\r\\nAnd
      take the present horror from the time,\\r\\nWhich now sutes with it. Whiles

      the stern'st good-night.\\r\\nHe is about it, the Doores are open:\\r\\nAnd
      the surfeted Groomes doe mock their charge\\r\\nWith Snores. I haue drugg'd
      their Possets,\\r\\nThat Death and Nature doe contend about them,\\r\\nWhether
      they liue, or dye.\\r\\nEnter Macbeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Macb. Who's there? what

      th' attempt, and not the deed,\\r\\nConfounds vs: hearke: I lay'd their Daggers
      ready,\\r\\nHe could not misse 'em. Had he not resembled\\r\\nMy Father as he
      slept, I had don't.\\r\\nMy Husband?\\r\\n  Macb. I haue done the deed:\\r\\nDidst
      thou not heare a noyse?\\r\\n  Lady. I heard the Owle schreame, and the Crickets

      i'th' second Chamber?\\r\\n  Lady. Donalbaine\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mac. This is a sorry
      sight\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lady. A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight\\r\\n\\r\\n
      \  Macb. There's one did laugh in's sleepe,\\r\\nAnd one cry'd Murther, that
      they did wake each other:\\r\\nI stood, and heard them: But they did say their
      Prayers,\\r\\nAnd addrest them againe to sleepe\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lady. There are
      two lodg'd together\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. One cry'd God blesse vs, and Amen the
      other,\\r\\nAs they had seene me with these Hangmans hands:\\r\\nListning their
      feare, I could not say Amen,\\r\\nWhen they did say God blesse vs\\r\\n\\r\\n
      \  Lady. Consider it not so deepely\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mac. But wherefore could not
      I pronounce Amen?\\r\\nI had most need of Blessing, and Amen stuck in my throat\\r\\n\\r\\n
      \  Lady. These deeds must not be thought\\r\\nAfter these wayes: so, it will
      make vs mad\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Me thought I heard a voyce cry, Sleep no more:\\r\\nMacbeth
      does murther Sleepe, the innocent Sleepe,\\r\\nSleepe that knits vp the rauel'd
      Sleeue of Care,\\r\\nThe death of each dayes Life, sore Labors Bath,\\r\\nBalme
      of hurt Mindes, great Natures second Course,\\r\\nChiefe nourisher in Life's
      Feast\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lady. What doe you meane?\\r\\n  Macb. Still it cry'd, Sleepe
      no more to all the House:\\r\\nGlamis hath murther'd Sleepe, and therefore Cawdor\\r\\nShall
      sleepe no more: Macbeth shall sleepe no more\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lady. Who was it,
      that thus cry'd? why worthy Thane,\\r\\nYou doe vnbend your Noble strength,
      to thinke\\r\\nSo braine-sickly of things: Goe get some Water,\\r\\nAnd wash
      this filthie Witnesse from your Hand.\\r\\nWhy did you bring these Daggers from
      the place?\\r\\nThey must lye there: goe carry them, and smeare\\r\\nThe sleepie
      Groomes with blood\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Ile goe no more:\\r\\nI am afraid, to
      thinke what I haue done:\\r\\nLooke on't againe, I dare not\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lady.
      Infirme of purpose:\\r\\nGiue me the Daggers: the sleeping, and the dead,\\r\\nAre
      but as Pictures: 'tis the Eye of Childhood,\\r\\nThat feares a painted Deuill.
      If he doe bleed,\\r\\nIle guild the Faces of the Groomes withall,\\r\\nFor it
      must seeme their Guilt.\\r\\nEnter.\\r\\n\\r\\nKnocke within.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Macb.

      Hands are here? hah: they pluck out mine Eyes.\\r\\nWill all great Neptunes
      Ocean wash this blood\\r\\nCleane from my Hand? no: this my Hand will rather\\r\\nThe

      Sleepe, and Vrine.\\r\\nLecherie, Sir, it prouokes, and vnprouokes: it prouokes\\r\\nthe
      desire, but it takes away the performance. Therefore\\r\\nmuch Drinke may be
      said to be an Equiuocator with Lecherie:\\r\\nit makes him, and it marres him;
      it sets him on,\\r\\nand it takes him off; it perswades him, and dis-heartens\\r\\nhim;

      worthy Thane?\\r\\n  Macb. Not yet\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. He did command me to
      call timely on him,\\r\\nI haue almost slipt the houre\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Ile
      bring you to him\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. I know this is a ioyfull trouble to you:\\r\\nBut
      yet 'tis one\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. The labour we delight in, Physicks paine:\\r\\nThis
      is the Doore\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Ile make so bold to call, for 'tis my limitted\\r\\nseruice.\\r\\n\\r\\nExit
      Macduffe.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Lenox. Goes the King hence to day?\\r\\n  Macb. He does:
      he did appoint so\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lenox. The Night ha's been vnruly:\\r\\nWhere
      we lay, our Chimneys were blowne downe,\\r\\nAnd (as they say) lamentings heard
      i'th' Ayre;\\r\\nStrange Schreemes of Death,\\r\\nAnd Prophecying, with Accents
      terrible,\\r\\nOf dyre Combustion, and confus'd Euents,\\r\\nNew hatch'd toth'
      wofull time.\\r\\nThe obscure Bird clamor'd the liue-long Night.\\r\\nSome say,
      the Earth was Feuorous,\\r\\nAnd did shake\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. 'Twas a rough

      the matter?\\r\\n  Macd. Confusion now hath made his Master-peece:\\r\\nMost
      sacrilegious Murther hath broke ope\\r\\nThe Lords anoynted Temple, and stole
      thence\\r\\nThe Life o'th' Building\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. What is't you say, the
      Life?\\r\\n  Lenox. Meane you his Maiestie?\\r\\n  Macd. Approch the Chamber,

      What's the Businesse?\\r\\nThat such a hideous Trumpet calls to parley\\r\\nThe
      sleepers of the House? speake, speake\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. O gentle Lady,\\r\\n'Tis
      not for you to heare what I can speake:\\r\\nThe repetition in a Womans eare,\\r\\nWould

      Had I but dy'd an houre before this chance,\\r\\nI had liu'd a blessed time:
      for from this instant,\\r\\nThere's nothing serious in Mortalitie:\\r\\nAll
      is but Toyes: Renowne and Grace is dead,\\r\\nThe Wine of Life is drawne, and
      the meere Lees\\r\\nIs left this Vault, to brag of.\\r\\nEnter Malcolme and
      Donalbaine.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Donal. What is amisse?\\r\\n  Macb. You are, and doe
      not know't:\\r\\nThe Spring, the Head, the Fountaine of your Blood\\r\\nIs stopt,

      Hands and Faces were all badg'd with blood,\\r\\nSo were their Daggers, which
      vnwip'd, we found\\r\\nVpon their Pillowes: they star'd, and were distracted,\\r\\nNo
      mans Life was to be trusted with them\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. O, yet I doe repent
      me of my furie,\\r\\nThat I did kill them\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Wherefore did
      you so?\\r\\n  Macb. Who can be wise, amaz'd, temp'rate, & furious,\\r\\nLoyall,
      and Neutrall, in a moment? No man:\\r\\nTh' expedition of my violent Loue\\r\\nOut-run
      the pawser, Reason. Here lay Duncan,\\r\\nHis Siluer skinne, lac'd with His
      Golden Blood,\\r\\nAnd his gash'd Stabs, look'd like a Breach in Nature,\\r\\nFor
      Ruines wastfull entrance: there the Murtherers,\\r\\nSteep'd in the Colours
      of their Trade; their Daggers\\r\\nVnmannerly breech'd with gore: who could
      refraine,\\r\\nThat had a heart to loue; and in that heart,\\r\\nCourage, to
      make's loue knowne?\\r\\n  Lady. Helpe me hence, hoa\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Looke
      to the Lady\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. Why doe we hold our tongues,\\r\\nThat most may
      clayme this argument for ours?\\r\\n  Donal. What should be spoken here,\\r\\nWhere
      our Fate hid in an augure hole,\\r\\nMay rush, and seize vs? Let's away,\\r\\nOur
      Teares are not yet brew'd\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. Nor our strong Sorrow\\r\\nVpon

      And so doe I\\r\\n\\r\\n   All. So all\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Let's briefely put

      predominance, or the Dayes shame,\\r\\nThat Darknesse does the face of Earth
      intombe,\\r\\nWhen liuing Light should kisse it?\\r\\n  Old man. 'Tis vnnaturall,\\r\\nEuen
      like the deed that's done: On Tuesday last,\\r\\nA Faulcon towring in her pride
      of place,\\r\\nWas by a Mowsing Owle hawkt at, and kill'd\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse.
      And Duncans Horses,\\r\\n(A thing most strange, and certaine)\\r\\nBeauteous,
      and swift, the Minions of their Race,\\r\\nTurn'd wilde in nature, broke their
      stalls, flong out,\\r\\nContending 'gainst Obedience, as they would\\r\\nMake

      Sir, now?\\r\\n  Macd. Why see you not?\\r\\n  Ross. Is't known who did this
      more then bloody deed?\\r\\n  Macd. Those that Macbeth hath slaine\\r\\n\\r\\n

      were subborned,\\r\\nMalcolme, and Donalbaine the Kings two Sonnes\\r\\nAre
      stolne away and fled, which puts vpon them\\r\\nSuspition of the deed\\r\\n\\r\\n

      yet it was saide\\r\\nIt should not stand in thy Posterity,\\r\\nBut that my
      selfe should be the Roote, and Father\\r\\nOf many Kings. If there come truth
      from them,\\r\\nAs vpon thee Macbeth, their Speeches shine,\\r\\nWhy by the

      become\\r\\nA womans story, at a Winters fire\\r\\nAuthoriz'd by her Grandam:
      shame it selfe,\\r\\nWhy do you make such faces? When all's done\\r\\nYou looke

      owe,\\r\\nWhen now I thinke you can behold such sights,\\r\\nAnd keepe the naturall
      Rubie of your Cheekes,\\r\\nWhen mine is blanch'd with feare\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse.
      What sights, my Lord?\\r\\n  La. I pray you speake not: he growes worse & worse\\r\\nQuestion

      Speeches,\\r\\nHaue but hit your Thoughts\\r\\nWhich can interpret farther:
      Onely I say\\r\\nThings haue bin strangely borne. The gracious Duncan\\r\\nWas
      pittied of Macbeth: marry he was dead:\\r\\nAnd the right valiant Banquo walk'd
      too late,\\r\\nWhom you may say (if't please you) Fleans kill'd,\\r\\nFor Fleans
      fled: Men must not walke too late.\\r\\nWho cannot want the thought, how monstrous\\r\\nIt
      was for Malcolme, and for Donalbane\\r\\nTo kill their gracious Father? Damned
      Fact,\\r\\nHow it did greeue Macbeth? Did he not straight\\r\\nIn pious rage,
      the two delinquents teare,\\r\\nThat were the Slaues of drinke, and thralles
      of sleepe?\\r\\nWas not that Nobly done? I, and wisely too:\\r\\nFor 'twould
      haue anger'd any heart aliue\\r\\nTo heare the men deny't. So that I say,\\r\\nHe
      ha's borne all things well, and I do thinke,\\r\\nThat had he Duncans Sonnes
      vnder his Key,\\r\\n(As, and't please Heauen he shall not) they should finde\\r\\nWhat
      'twere to kill a Father: So should Fleans.\\r\\nBut peace; for from broad words,

      grace,\\r\\nThat the maleuolence of Fortune, nothing\\r\\nTakes from his high

      I may tell pale-hearted Feare, it lies;\\r\\nAnd sleepe in spight of Thunder.\\r\\n\\r\\nThunder
      3 Apparation, a Childe Crowned, with a Tree in his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is
      this, that rises like the issue of a King,\\r\\nAnd weares vpon his Baby-brow,
      the round\\r\\nAnd top of Soueraignty?\\r\\n  All. Listen, but speake not too't\\r\\n\\r\\n
      \  3 Appar. Be Lyon metled, proud, and take no care:\\r\\nWho chafes, who frets,
      or where Conspirers are:\\r\\nMacbeth shall neuer vanquish'd be, vntill\\r\\nGreat
      Byrnam Wood, to high Dunsmane Hill\\r\\nShall come against him.\\r\\n\\r\\nDescend.\\r\\n\\r\\n
      \ Macb. That will neuer bee:\\r\\nWho can impresse the Forrest, bid the Tree\\r\\nVnfixe
      his earth-bound Root? Sweet boadments, good:\\r\\nRebellious dead, rise neuer
      till the Wood\\r\\nOf Byrnan rise, and our high plac'd Macbeth\\r\\nShall liue
      the Lease of Nature, pay his breath\\r\\nTo time, and mortall Custome. Yet my
      Hart\\r\\nThrobs to know one thing: Tell me, if your Art\\r\\nCan tell so much:
      Shall Banquo's issue euer\\r\\nReigne in this Kingdome?\\r\\n  All. Seeke to
      know no more\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. I will be satisfied. Deny me this,\\r\\nAnd

      Down:\\r\\nThy Crowne do's seare mine Eye-bals. And thy haire\\r\\nThou other
      Gold-bound-brow, is like the first:\\r\\nA third, is like the former. Filthy

      the Line stretch out to'th' cracke of Doome?\\r\\nAnother yet? A seauenth? Ile
      see no more:\\r\\nAnd yet the eighth appeares, who beares a glasse,\\r\\nWhich
      shewes me many more: and some I see,\\r\\nThat two-fold Balles, and trebble
      Scepters carry.\\r\\nHorrible sight: Now I see 'tis true,\\r\\nFor the Blood-bolter'd
      Banquo smiles vpon me,\\r\\nAnd points at them for his. What? is this so?\\r\\n
      \ 1 I Sir, all this is so. But why\\r\\nStands Macbeth thus amazedly?\\r\\nCome

      shall be\\r\\nThe firstlings of my hand. And euen now\\r\\nTo Crown my thoughts
      with Acts: be it thoght & done:\\r\\nThe Castle of Macduff, I will surprize.\\r\\nSeize
      vpon Fife; giue to th' edge o'th' Sword\\r\\nHis Wife, his Babes, and all vnfortunate
      Soules\\r\\nThat trace him in his Line. No boasting like a Foole,\\r\\nThis
      deed Ile do, before this purpose coole,\\r\\nBut no more sights. Where are these
      Gentlemen?\\r\\nCome bring me where they are.\\r\\n\\r\\nExeunt.\\r\\n\\r\\nScena
      Secunda.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter Macduffes Wife, her Son, and Rosse.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Wife.
      What had he done, to make him fly the Land?\\r\\n  Rosse. You must haue patience
      Madam\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. He had none:\\r\\nHis flight was madnesse: when our
      Actions do not,\\r\\nOur feares do make vs Traitors\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. You
      know not\\r\\nWhether it was his wisedome, or his feare\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife.
      Wisedom? to leaue his wife, to leaue his Babes,\\r\\nHis Mansion, and his Titles,
      in a place\\r\\nFrom whence himselfe do's flye? He loues vs not,\\r\\nHe wants
      the naturall touch. For the poore Wren\\r\\n(The most diminitiue of Birds) will
      fight,\\r\\nHer yong ones in her Nest, against the Owle:\\r\\nAll is the Feare,
      and nothing is the Loue;\\r\\nAs little is the Wisedome, where the flight\\r\\nSo
      runnes against all reason\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. My deerest Cooz,\\r\\nI pray
      you schoole your selfe. But for your Husband,\\r\\nHe is Noble, Wise, Iudicious,
      and best knowes\\r\\nThe fits o'th' Season. I dare not speake much further,\\r\\nBut
      cruell are the times, when we are Traitors\\r\\nAnd do not know our selues:
      when we hold Rumor\\r\\nFrom what we feare, yet know not what we feare,\\r\\nBut
      floate vpon a wilde and violent Sea\\r\\nEach way, and moue. I take my leaue
      of you:\\r\\nShall not be long but Ile be heere againe:\\r\\nThings at the worst
      will cease, or else climbe vpward,\\r\\nTo what they were before. My pretty
      Cosine,\\r\\nBlessing vpon you\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. Father'd he is,\\r\\nAnd
      yet hee's Father-lesse\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. I am so much a Foole, should I stay
      longer\\r\\nIt would be my disgrace, and your discomfort.\\r\\nI take my leaue
      at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nExit Rosse.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Wife. Sirra, your Fathers dead,\\r\\nAnd
      what will you do now? How will you liue?\\r\\n  Son. As Birds do Mother\\r\\n\\r\\n
      \  Wife. What with Wormes, and Flyes?\\r\\n  Son. With what I get I meane, and
      so do they\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. Poore Bird,\\r\\nThou'dst neuer Feare the Net,
      nor Lime,\\r\\nThe Pitfall, nor the Gin\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. Why should I Mother?\\r\\nPoore
      Birds they are not set for:\\r\\nMy Father is not dead for all your saying\\r\\n\\r\\n
      \  Wife. Yes, he is dead:\\r\\nHow wilt thou do for a Father?\\r\\n  Son. Nay
      how will you do for a Husband?\\r\\n  Wife. Why I can buy me twenty at any Market\\r\\n\\r\\n
      \  Son. Then you'l by 'em to sell againe\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. Thou speak'st withall
      thy wit,\\r\\nAnd yet I'faith with wit enough for thee\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. Was
      my Father a Traitor, Mother?\\r\\n  Wife. I, that he was\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son.
      What is a Traitor?\\r\\n  Wife. Why one that sweares, and lyes\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son.
      And be all Traitors, that do so\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. Euery one that do's so,
      is a Traitor,\\r\\nAnd must be hang'd\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. And must they all be
      hang'd, that swear and lye?\\r\\n  Wife. Euery one\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. Who must
      hang them?\\r\\n  Wife. Why, the honest men\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. Then the Liars
      and Swearers are Fools: for there\\r\\nare Lyars and Swearers enow, to beate
      the honest men,\\r\\nand hang vp them\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. Now God helpe thee,
      poore Monkie:\\r\\nBut how wilt thou do for a Father?\\r\\n  Son. If he were
      dead, youl'd weepe for him: if you\\r\\nwould not, it were a good signe, that
      I should quickely\\r\\nhaue a new Father\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. Poore pratler,
      how thou talk'st?\\r\\nEnter a Messenger.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mes. Blesse you faire
      Dame: I am not to you known,\\r\\nThough in your state of Honor I am perfect;\\r\\nI
      doubt some danger do's approach you neerely.\\r\\nIf you will take a homely
      mans aduice,\\r\\nBe not found heere: Hence with your little ones\\r\\nTo fright
      you thus. Me thinkes I am too sauage:\\r\\nTo do worse to you, were fell Cruelty,\\r\\nWhich
      is too nie your person. Heauen preserue you,\\r\\nI dare abide no longer.\\r\\n\\r\\nExit
      Messenger\\r\\n\\r\\n  Wife. Whether should I flye?\\r\\nI haue done no harme.
      But I remember now\\r\\nI am in this earthly world: where to do harme\\r\\nIs
      often laudable, to do good sometime\\r\\nAccounted dangerous folly. Why then
      (alas)\\r\\nDo I put vp that womanly defence,\\r\\nTo say I haue done no harme?\\r\\nWhat
      are these faces?\\r\\nEnter Murtherers.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mur. Where is your Husband?\\r\\n
      \ Wife. I hope in no place so vnsanctified,\\r\\nWhere such as thou may'st finde
      him\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mur. He's a Traitor\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. Thou ly'st thou shagge-ear'd
      Villaine\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mur. What you Egge?\\r\\nYong fry of Treachery?\\r\\n
      \ Son. He ha's kill'd me Mother,\\r\\nRun away I pray you.\\r\\n\\r\\nExit crying
      Murther.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nScaena Tertia.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter Malcolme and Macduffe.\\r\\n\\r\\n
      \ Mal. Let vs seeke out some desolate shade, & there\\r\\nWeepe our sad bosomes
      empty\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Let vs rather\\r\\nHold fast the mortall Sword: and
      like good men,\\r\\nBestride our downfall Birthdome: each new Morne,\\r\\nNew
      Widdowes howle, new Orphans cry, new sorowes\\r\\nStrike heauen on the face,
      that it resounds\\r\\nAs if it felt with Scotland, and yell'd out\\r\\nLike
      Syllable of Dolour\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. What I beleeue, Ile waile;\\r\\nWhat know,
      beleeue; and what I can redresse,\\r\\nAs I shall finde the time to friend:
      I wil.\\r\\nWhat you haue spoke, it may be so perchance.\\r\\nThis Tyrant, whose
      sole name blisters our tongues,\\r\\nWas once thought honest: you haue lou'd
      him well,\\r\\nHe hath not touch'd you yet. I am yong, but something\\r\\nYou
      may discerne of him through me, and wisedome\\r\\nTo offer vp a weake, poore
      innocent Lambe\\r\\nT' appease an angry God\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. I am not treacherous\\r\\n\\r\\n
      \  Malc. But Macbeth is.\\r\\nA good and vertuous Nature may recoyle\\r\\nIn
      an Imperiall charge. But I shall craue your pardon:\\r\\nThat which you are,
      my thoughts cannot transpose;\\r\\nAngels are bright still, though the brightest
      fell.\\r\\nThough all things foule, would wear the brows of grace\\r\\nYet Grace
      must still looke so\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. I haue lost my Hopes\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc.
      Perchance euen there\\r\\nWhere I did finde my doubts.\\r\\nWhy in that rawnesse
      left you Wife, and Childe?\\r\\nThose precious Motiues, those strong knots of
      Loue,\\r\\nWithout leaue-taking. I pray you,\\r\\nLet not my Iealousies, be
      your Dishonors,\\r\\nBut mine owne Safeties: you may be rightly iust,\\r\\nWhat
      euer I shall thinke\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Bleed, bleed poore Country,\\r\\nGreat
      Tyrrany, lay thou thy basis sure,\\r\\nFor goodnesse dare not check thee: wear
      y thy wrongs,\\r\\nThe Title, is affear'd. Far thee well Lord,\\r\\nI would
      not be the Villaine that thou think'st,\\r\\nFor the whole Space that's in the
      Tyrants Graspe,\\r\\nAnd the rich East to boot\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. Be not offended:\\r\\nI
      speake not as in absolute feare of you:\\r\\nI thinke our Country sinkes beneath
      the yoake,\\r\\nIt weepes, it bleeds, and each new day a gash\\r\\nIs added
      to her wounds. I thinke withall,\\r\\nThere would be hands vplifted in my right:\\r\\nAnd
      heere from gracious England haue I offer\\r\\nOf goodly thousands. But for all
      this,\\r\\nWhen I shall treade vpon the Tyrants head,\\r\\nOr weare it on my
      Sword; yet my poore Country\\r\\nShall haue more vices then it had before,\\r\\nMore
      suffer, and more sundry wayes then euer,\\r\\nBy him that shall succeede\\r\\n\\r\\n
      \  Macd. What should he be?\\r\\n  Mal. It is my selfe I meane: in whom I know\\r\\nAll
      the particulars of Vice so grafted,\\r\\nThat when they shall be open'd, blacke
      Macbeth\\r\\nWill seeme as pure as Snow, and the poore State\\r\\nEsteeme him
      as a Lambe, being compar'd\\r\\nWith my confinelesse harmes\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd.
      Not in the Legions\\r\\nOf horrid Hell, can come a Diuell more damn'd\\r\\nIn
      euils, to top Macbeth\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. I grant him Bloody,\\r\\nLuxurious,
      Auaricious, False, Deceitfull,\\r\\nSodaine, Malicious, smacking of euery sinne\\r\\nThat
      ha's a name. But there's no bottome, none\\r\\nIn my Voluptuousnesse: Your Wiues,
      your Daughters,\\r\\nYour Matrons, and your Maides, could not fill vp\\r\\nThe
      Cesterne of my Lust, and my Desire\\r\\nAll continent Impediments would ore-beare\\r\\nThat
      did oppose my will. Better Macbeth,\\r\\nThen such an one to reigne\\r\\n\\r\\n
      \  Macd. Boundlesse intemperance\\r\\nIn Nature is a Tyranny: It hath beene\\r\\nTh'
      vntimely emptying of the happy Throne,\\r\\nAnd fall of many Kings. But feare
      not yet\\r\\nTo take vpon you what is yours: you may\\r\\nConuey your pleasures
      in a spacious plenty,\\r\\nAnd yet seeme cold. The time you may so hoodwinke:\\r\\nWe
      haue willing Dames enough: there cannot be\\r\\nThat Vulture in you, to deuoure
      so many\\r\\nAs will to Greatnesse dedicate themselues,\\r\\nFinding it so inclinde\\r\\n\\r\\n
      \  Mal. With this, there growes\\r\\nIn my most ill-composd Affection, such\\r\\nA
      stanchlesse Auarice, that were I King,\\r\\nI should cut off the Nobles for
      their Lands,\\r\\nDesire his Iewels, and this others House,\\r\\nAnd my more-hauing,
      would be as a Sawce\\r\\nTo make me hunger more, that I should forge\\r\\nQuarrels
      vniust against the Good and Loyall,\\r\\nDestroying them for wealth\\r\\n\\r\\n
      \  Macd. This Auarice\\r\\nstickes deeper: growes with more pernicious roote\\r\\nThen
      Summer-seeming Lust: and it hath bin\\r\\nThe Sword of our slaine Kings: yet
      do not feare,\\r\\nScotland hath Foysons, to fill vp your will\\r\\nOf your
      meere Owne. All these are portable,\\r\\nWith other Graces weigh'd\\r\\n\\r\\n
      \  Mal. But I haue none. The King-becoming Graces,\\r\\nAs Iustice, Verity,
      Temp'rance, Stablenesse,\\r\\nBounty, Perseuerance, Mercy, Lowlinesse,\\r\\nDeuotion,
      Patience, Courage, Fortitude,\\r\\nI haue no rellish of them, but abound\\r\\nIn
      the diuision of each seuerall Crime,\\r\\nActing it many wayes. Nay, had I powre,
      I should\\r\\nPoure the sweet Milke of Concord, into Hell,\\r\\nVprore the vniuersall
      peace, confound\\r\\nAll vnity on earth\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. O Scotland, Scotland\\r\\n\\r\\n
      \  Mal. If such a one be fit to gouerne, speake:\\r\\nI am as I haue spoken\\r\\n\\r\\n
      \  Mac. Fit to gouern? No not to liue. O Natio[n] miserable!\\r\\nWith an vntitled
      Tyrant, bloody Sceptred,\\r\\nWhen shalt thou see thy wholsome dayes againe?\\r\\nSince
      that the truest Issue of thy Throne\\r\\nBy his owne Interdiction stands accust,\\r\\nAnd
      do's blaspheme his breed? Thy Royall Father\\r\\nWas a most Sainted-King: the
      Queene that bore thee,\\r\\nOftner vpon her knees, then on her feet,\\r\\nDy'de
      euery day she liu'd. Fare thee well,\\r\\nThese Euils thou repeat'st vpon thy
      selfe,\\r\\nHath banish'd me from Scotland. O my Brest,\\r\\nThy hope ends heere\\r\\n\\r\\n
      \  Mal. Macduff, this Noble passion\\r\\nChilde of integrity, hath from my soule\\r\\nWip'd
      the blacke Scruples, reconcil'd my thoughts\\r\\nTo thy good Truth, and Honor.
      Diuellish Macbeth,\\r\\nBy many of these traines, hath sought to win me\\r\\nInto
      his power: and modest Wisedome pluckes me\\r\\nFrom ouer-credulous hast: but
      God aboue\\r\\nDeale betweene thee and me; For euen now\\r\\nI put my selfe
      to thy Direction, and\\r\\nVnspeake mine owne detraction. Heere abiure\\r\\nThe
      taints, and blames I laide vpon my selfe,\\r\\nFor strangers to my Nature. I
      am yet\\r\\nVnknowne to Woman, neuer was forsworne,\\r\\nScarsely haue coueted
      what was mine owne.\\r\\nAt no time broke my Faith, would not betray\\r\\nThe
      Deuill to his Fellow, and delight\\r\\nNo lesse in truth then life. My first
      false speaking\\r\\nWas this vpon my selfe. What I am truly\\r\\nIs thine, and
      my poore Countries to command:\\r\\nWhither indeed, before they heere approach\\r\\nOld
      Seyward with ten thousand warlike men\\r\\nAlready at a point, was setting foorth:\\r\\nNow
      wee'l together, and the chance of goodnesse\\r\\nBe like our warranted Quarrell.
      Why are you silent?\\r\\n  Macd. Such welcome, and vnwelcom things at once\\r\\n'Tis
      hard to reconcile.\\r\\nEnter a Doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mal. Well, more anon. Comes
      the King forth\\r\\nI pray you?\\r\\n  Doct. I Sir: there are a crew of wretched
      Soules\\r\\nThat stay his Cure: their malady conuinces\\r\\nThe great assay
      of Art. But at his touch,\\r\\nSuch sanctity hath Heauen giuen his hand,\\r\\nThey
      presently amend.\\r\\nEnter.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mal. I thanke you Doctor\\r\\n\\r\\n
      \  Macd. What's the Disease he meanes?\\r\\n  Mal. Tis call'd the Euill.\\r\\nA
      most myraculous worke in this good King,\\r\\nWhich often since my heere remaine
      in England,\\r\\nI haue seene him do: How he solicites heauen\\r\\nHimselfe
      best knowes: but strangely visited people\\r\\nAll swolne and Vlcerous, pittifull
      to the eye,\\r\\nThe meere dispaire of Surgery, he cures,\\r\\nHanging a golden
      stampe about their neckes,\\r\\nPut on with holy Prayers, and 'tis spoken\\r\\nTo
      the succeeding Royalty he leaues\\r\\nThe healing Benediction. With this strange
      vertue,\\r\\nHe hath a heauenly guift of Prophesie,\\r\\nAnd sundry Blessings
      hang about his Throne,\\r\\nThat speake him full of Grace.\\r\\nEnter Rosse.\\r\\n\\r\\n
      \ Macd. See who comes heere\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. My Countryman: but yet I know
      him not\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. My euer gentle Cozen, welcome hither\\r\\n\\r\\n
      \  Malc. I know him now. Good God betimes remoue\\r\\nThe meanes that makes
      vs Strangers\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. Sir, Amen\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Stands Scotland
      where it did?\\r\\n  Rosse. Alas poore Countrey,\\r\\nAlmost affraid to know
      it selfe. It cannot\\r\\nBe call'd our Mother, but our Graue; where nothing\\r\\nBut
      who knowes nothing, is once seene to smile:\\r\\nWhere sighes, and groanes,
      and shrieks that rent the ayre\\r\\nAre made, not mark'd: Where violent sorrow
      seemes\\r\\nA Moderne extasie: The Deadmans knell,\\r\\nIs there scarse ask'd
      for who, and good mens liues\\r\\nExpire before the Flowers in their Caps,\\r\\nDying,
      or ere they sicken\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Oh Relation; too nice, and yet too true\\r\\n\\r\\n
      \  Malc. What's the newest griefe?\\r\\n  Rosse. That of an houres age, doth
      hisse the speaker,\\r\\nEach minute teemes a new one\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. How
      do's my Wife?\\r\\n  Rosse. Why well\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. And all my Children?\\r\\n
      \ Rosse. Well too\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. The Tyrant ha's not batter'd at their
      peace?\\r\\n  Rosse. No, they were wel at peace, when I did leaue 'em\\r\\n
      \ Macd. Be not a niggard of your speech: How gos't?\\r\\n  Rosse. When I came
      hither to transport the Tydings\\r\\nWhich I haue heauily borne, there ran a
      Rumour\\r\\nOf many worthy Fellowes, that were out,\\r\\nWhich was to my beleefe
      witnest the rather,\\r\\nFor that I saw the Tyrants Power a-foot.\\r\\nNow is
      the time of helpe: your eye in Scotland\\r\\nWould create Soldiours, make our
      women fight,\\r\\nTo doffe their dire distresses\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. Bee't their
      comfort\\r\\nWe are comming thither: Gracious England hath\\r\\nLent vs good
      Seyward, and ten thousand men,\\r\\nAn older, and a better Souldier, none\\r\\nThat
      Christendome giues out\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. Would I could answer\\r\\nThis comfort
      with the like. But I haue words\\r\\nThat would be howl'd out in the desert
      ayre,\\r\\nWhere hearing should not latch them\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. What concerne

      (one page)\\r\\n\\r\\nWe produce about two million dollars for each hour we
      work.  The\\r\\ntime it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours\\r\\nto
      get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright\\r\\nsearched
      and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This\\r\\nprojected audience
      is one hundred million readers.  If our value\\r\\nper text is nominally estimated
      at one dollar then we produce $2\\r\\nmillion dollars per hour this year as
      we release thirty-six text\\r\\nfiles per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999
      for a total of 2000+\\r\\nIf these reach just 10% of the computerized population,
      then the\\r\\ntotal should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe
      Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext\\r\\nFiles by December
      31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]\\r\\nThis is ten thousand titles
      each to one hundred million readers,\\r\\nwhich is only ~5% of the present number
      of computer users.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt our revised rates of production, we will reach
      only one-third\\r\\nof that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless
      we\\r\\nmanage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly\\r\\nfrom
      Michael Hart's salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an\\r\\nassortment
      of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few\\r\\nmore years, so we
      are looking for something to replace it, as we\\r\\ndon't want Project Gutenberg

      Director's Notes:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the notes below, and so you will
      *NOT* think all\\r\\nthe spelling errors introduced by the printers of the time
      have\\r\\nbeen corrected, here are the first few lines of Hamlet, as they\\r\\nare
      presented herein:\\r\\n\\r\\n  Barnardo. Who's there?\\r\\n  Fran. Nay answer
      me: Stand & vnfold\\r\\nyour selfe\\r\\n\\r\\n   Bar. Long liue the King\\r\\n\\r\\n***\\r\\n\\r\\nAs
      I understand it, the printers often ran out of certain words\\r\\nor letters
      they had often packed into a \\\"cliche\\\". . .this is the\\r\\noriginal meaning
      of the term cliche. . .and thus, being unwilling\\r\\nto unpack the cliches,
      and thus you will see some substitutions\\r\\nthat look very odd. . .such as
      the exchanges of u for v, v for u,\\r\\nabove. . .and you may wonder why they
      did it this way, presuming\\r\\nShakespeare did not actually write the play
      in this manner. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\nThe answer is that they MAY have packed \\\"liue\\\"
      into a cliche at a\\r\\ntime when they were out of \\\"v\\\"'s. . .possibly
      having used \\\"vv\\\" in\\r\\nplace of some \\\"w\\\"'s, etc.  This was a common
      practice of the day,\\r\\nas print was still quite expensive, and they didn't
      want to spend\\r\\nmore on a wider selection of characters than they had to.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou
      will find a lot of these kinds of \\\"errors\\\" in this text, as I\\r\\nhave
      mentioned in other times and places, many \\\"scholars\\\" have an\\r\\nextreme
      attachment to these errors, and many have accorded them a\\r\\nvery high place
      in the \\\"canon\\\" of Shakespeare.  My father read an\\r\\nassortment of these
      made available to him by Cambridge University\\r\\nin England for several months
      in a glass room constructed for the\\r\\npurpose.  To the best of my knowledge
      he read ALL those available\\r\\n. . .in great detail. . .and determined from
      the various changes,\\r\\nthat Shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly
      as many of a\\r\\nvariety of errors we credit him for, even though he was in/famous\\r\\nfor
      signing his name with several different spellings.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, please take
      this into account when reading the comments below\\r\\nmade by our volunteer
      who prepared this file:  you may see errors\\r\\nthat are \\\"not\\\" errors.
      . . .\\r\\n\\r\\nSo. . .with this caveat. . .we have NOT changed the canon errors,\\r\\nhere
      is the Project Gutenberg Etext of Shakespeare's The Tragedie\\r\\nof Macbeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nMichael

      Notes: What this is and isn't.  This was taken from\\r\\na copy of Shakespeare's
      first folio and it is as close as I can\\r\\ncome in ASCII to the printed text.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe
      elongated S's have been changed to small s's and the\\r\\nconjoined ae have
      been changed to ae.  I have left the spelling,\\r\\npunctuation, capitalization
      as close as possible to the\\r\\nprinted text.  I have corrected some spelling
      mistakes (I have put\\r\\ntogether a spelling dictionary devised from the spellings
      of the\\r\\nGeneva Bible and Shakespeare's First Folio and have unified\\r\\nspellings
      according to this template), typo's and expanded\\r\\nabbreviations as I have
      come across them.  Everything within\\r\\nbrackets [] is what I have added.
      \ So if you don't like that\\r\\nyou can delete everything within the brackets
      if you want a\\r\\npurer Shakespeare.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother thing that you should
      be aware of is that there are textual\\r\\ndifferences between various copies
      of the first folio.  So there may\\r\\nbe differences (other than what I have
      mentioned above) between\\r\\nthis and other first folio editions.  This is
      due to the printer's\\r\\nhabit of setting the type and running off a number
      of copies and\\r\\nthen proofing the printed copy and correcting the type and
      then\\r\\ncontinuing the printing run.  The proof run wasn't thrown away but\\r\\nincorporated
      into the printed copies.  This is just the way it is.\\r\\nThe text I have used
      was a composite of more than 30 different\\r\\nFirst Folio editions' best pages.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf
      you find any scanning errors, out and out typos, punctuation\\r\\nerrors, or
      if you disagree with my spelling choices please feel\\r\\nfree to email me those
      errors.  I wish to make this the best\\r\\netext possible.  My email address
      for right now are haradda@aol.com\\r\\nand davidr@inconnect.com.  I hope that
      you enjoy this.\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid Reed\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tragedie of Macbeth\\r\\n\\r\\nActus

      looke not like th' Inhabitants o'th' Earth,\\r\\nAnd yet are on't? Liue you,

      Speakers, tell me more:\\r\\nBy Sinells death, I know I am Thane of Glamis,\\r\\nBut
      how, of Cawdor? the Thane of Cawdor liues\\r\\nA prosperous Gentleman: And to
      be King,\\r\\nStands not within the prospect of beleefe,\\r\\nNo more then to
      be Cawdor. Say from whence\\r\\nYou owe this strange Intelligence, or why\\r\\nVpon
      this blasted Heath you stop our way\\r\\nWith such Prophetique greeting?\\r\\nSpeake,
      I charge you.\\r\\n\\r\\nWitches vanish.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Banq. The Earth hath bubbles,

      as we doe speake about?\\r\\nOr haue we eaten on the insane Root,\\r\\nThat
      takes the Reason Prisoner?\\r\\n  Macb. Your Children shall be Kings\\r\\n\\r\\n

      Rosse and Angus.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Rosse. The King hath happily receiu'd, Macbeth,\\r\\nThe
      newes of thy successe: and when he reades\\r\\nThy personall Venture in the
      Rebels sight,\\r\\nHis Wonders and his Prayses doe contend,\\r\\nWhich should
      be thine, or his: silenc'd with that,\\r\\nIn viewing o're the rest o'th' selfe-same
      day,\\r\\nHe findes thee in the stout Norweyan Rankes,\\r\\nNothing afeard of
      what thy selfe didst make\\r\\nStrange Images of death, as thick as Tale\\r\\nCan
      post with post, and euery one did beare\\r\\nThy prayses in his Kingdomes great

      he was combin'd with those of Norway,\\r\\nOr did lyne the Rebell with hidden
      helpe,\\r\\nAnd vantage; or that with both he labour'd\\r\\nIn his Countreyes

      a word, I pray you\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Two Truths are told,\\r\\nAs happy Prologues
      to the swelling Act\\r\\nOf the Imperiall Theame. I thanke you Gentlemen:\\r\\nThis
      supernaturall solliciting\\r\\nCannot be ill; cannot be good.\\r\\nIf ill? why
      hath it giuen me earnest of successe,\\r\\nCommencing in a Truth? I am Thane
      of Cawdor.\\r\\nIf good? why doe I yeeld to that suggestion,\\r\\nWhose horrid
      Image doth vnfixe my Heire,\\r\\nAnd make my seated Heart knock at my Ribbes,\\r\\nAgainst
      the vse of Nature? Present Feares\\r\\nAre lesse then horrible Imaginings:\\r\\nMy
      Thought, whose Murther yet is but fantasticall,\\r\\nShakes so my single state

      almost dead for breath, had scarcely more\\r\\nThen would make vp his Message\\r\\n\\r\\n

      \  Macb. My dearest Loue,\\r\\nDuncan comes here to Night\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lady.
      And when goes hence?\\r\\n  Macb. To morrow, as he purposes\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lady.
      O neuer,\\r\\nShall Sunne that Morrow see.\\r\\nYour Face, my Thane, is as a

      does approue,\\r\\nBy his loued Mansonry, that the Heauens breath\\r\\nSmells
      wooingly here: no Iutty frieze,\\r\\nButtrice, nor Coigne of Vantage, but this
      Bird\\r\\nHath made his pendant Bed, and procreant Cradle,\\r\\nWhere they must
      breed, and haunt: I haue obseru'd\\r\\nThe ayre is delicate.\\r\\nEnter Lady.\\r\\n\\r\\n
      \ King. See, see our honor'd Hostesse:\\r\\nThe Loue that followes vs, sometime
      is our trouble,\\r\\nWhich still we thanke as Loue. Herein I teach you,\\r\\nHow
      you shall bid God-eyld vs for your paines,\\r\\nAnd thanke vs for your trouble\\r\\n\\r\\n

      \  King. Where's the Thane of Cawdor?\\r\\nWe courst him at the heeles, and
      had a purpose\\r\\nTo be his Purueyor: But he rides well,\\r\\nAnd his great
      Loue (sharpe as his Spurre) hath holp him\\r\\nTo his home before vs: Faire

      quickly: If th' Assassination\\r\\nCould trammell vp the Consequence, and catch\\r\\nWith
      his surcease, Successe: that but this blow\\r\\nMight be the be all, and the
      end all. Heere,\\r\\nBut heere, vpon this Banke and Schoole of time,\\r\\nWee'ld

      that we but teach\\r\\nBloody Instructions, which being taught, returne\\r\\nTo
      plague th' Inuenter, this euen-handed Iustice\\r\\nCommends th' Ingredience
      of our poyson'd Challice\\r\\nTo our owne lips. Hee's heere in double trust;\\r\\nFirst,
      as I am his Kinsman, and his Subiect,\\r\\nStrong both against the Deed: Then,
      as his Host,\\r\\nWho should against his Murtherer shut the doore,\\r\\nNot
      beare the knife my selfe. Besides, this Duncane\\r\\nHath borne his Faculties
      so meeke; hath bin\\r\\nSo cleere in his great Office, that his Vertues\\r\\nWill
      pleade like Angels, Trumpet-tongu'd against\\r\\nThe deepe damnation of his
      taking off:\\r\\nAnd Pitty, like a naked New-borne-Babe,\\r\\nStriding the blast,
      or Heauens Cherubin, hors'd\\r\\nVpon the sightlesse Curriors of the Ayre,\\r\\nShall
      blow the horrid deed in euery eye,\\r\\nThat teares shall drowne the winde.

      you left the chamber?\\r\\n  Mac. Hath he ask'd for me?\\r\\n  La. Know you
      not, he ha's?\\r\\n  Mac. We will proceed no further in this Businesse:\\r\\nHe
      hath Honour'd me of late, and I haue bought\\r\\nGolden Opinions from all sorts
      of people,\\r\\nWhich would be worne now in their newest glosse,\\r\\nNot cast
      aside so soone\\r\\n\\r\\n   La. Was the hope drunke,\\r\\nWherein you drest
      your selfe? Hath it slept since?\\r\\nAnd wakes it now to looke so greene, and
      pale,\\r\\nAt what it did so freely? From this time,\\r\\nSuch I account thy
      loue. Art thou affear'd\\r\\nTo be the same in thine owne Act, and Valour,\\r\\nAs
      thou art in desire? Would'st thou haue that\\r\\nWhich thou esteem'st the Ornament
      of Life,\\r\\nAnd liue a Coward in thine owne Esteeme?\\r\\nLetting I dare not,
      wait vpon I would,\\r\\nLike the poore Cat i'th' Addage\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb.
      Prythee peace:\\r\\nI dare do all that may become a man,\\r\\nWho dares do more,
      is none\\r\\n\\r\\n   La. What Beast was't then\\r\\nThat made you breake this
      enterprize to me?\\r\\nWhen you durst do it, then you were a man:\\r\\nAnd to
      be more then what you were, you would\\r\\nBe so much more the man. Nor time,
      nor place\\r\\nDid then adhere, and yet you would make both:\\r\\nThey haue
      made themselues, and that their fitnesse now\\r\\nDo's vnmake you. I haue giuen
      Sucke, and know\\r\\nHow tender 'tis to loue the Babe that milkes me,\\r\\nI
      would, while it was smyling in my Face,\\r\\nHaue pluckt my Nipple from his
      Bonelesse Gummes,\\r\\nAnd dasht the Braines out, had I so sworne\\r\\nAs you
      haue done to this\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. If we should faile?\\r\\n  Lady. We faile?\\r\\nBut
      screw your courage to the sticking place,\\r\\nAnd wee'le not fayle: when Duncan
      is asleepe,\\r\\n(Whereto the rather shall his dayes hard Iourney\\r\\nSoundly
      inuite him) his two Chamberlaines\\r\\nWill I with Wine, and Wassell, so conuince,\\r\\nThat
      Memorie, the Warder of the Braine,\\r\\nShall be a Fume, and the Receit of Reason\\r\\nA

      What not put vpon\\r\\nHis spungie Officers? who shall beare the guilt\\r\\nOf

      we haue mark'd with blood those sleepie two\\r\\nOf his owne Chamber, and vs'd

      it other,\\r\\nAs we shall make our Griefes and Clamor rore,\\r\\nVpon his Death?\\r\\n
      \ Macb. I am settled, and bend vp\\r\\nEach corporall Agent to this terrible
      Feat.\\r\\nAway, and mock the time with fairest show,\\r\\nFalse Face must hide
      what the false Heart doth know.\\r\\n\\r\\nExeunt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nActus Secundus.

      'tis, it shall make Honor for you\\r\\n\\r\\n   Banq. So I lose none,\\r\\nIn
      seeking to augment it, but still keepe\\r\\nMy Bosome franchis'd, and Allegeance

      Get thee to bed.\\r\\nEnter.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs this a Dagger, which I see before

      not, and yet I see thee still.\\r\\nArt thou not fatall Vision, sensible\\r\\nTo
      feeling, as to sight? or art thou but\\r\\nA Dagger of the Minde, a false Creation,\\r\\nProceeding
      from the heat-oppressed Braine?\\r\\nI see thee yet, in forme as palpable,\\r\\nAs
      this which now I draw.\\r\\nThou marshall'st me the way that I was going,\\r\\nAnd
      such an Instrument I was to vse.\\r\\nMine Eyes are made the fooles o'th' other
      Sences,\\r\\nOr else worth all the rest: I see thee still;\\r\\nAnd on thy Blade,
      and Dudgeon, Gouts of Blood,\\r\\nWhich was not so before. There's no such thing:\\r\\nIt
      is the bloody Businesse, which informes\\r\\nThus to mine Eyes. Now o're the
      one halfe World\\r\\nNature seemes dead, and wicked Dreames abuse\\r\\nThe Curtain'd
      sleepe: Witchcraft celebrates\\r\\nPale Heccats Offrings: and wither'd Murther,\\r\\nAlarum'd
      by his Centinell, the Wolfe,\\r\\nWhose howle's his Watch, thus with his stealthy
      pace,\\r\\nWith Tarquins rauishing sides, towards his designe\\r\\nMoues like

      may walke, for feare\\r\\nThy very stones prate of my where-about,\\r\\nAnd
      take the present horror from the time,\\r\\nWhich now sutes with it. Whiles

      the stern'st good-night.\\r\\nHe is about it, the Doores are open:\\r\\nAnd
      the surfeted Groomes doe mock their charge\\r\\nWith Snores. I haue drugg'd
      their Possets,\\r\\nThat Death and Nature doe contend about them,\\r\\nWhether
      they liue, or dye.\\r\\nEnter Macbeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Macb. Who's there? what

      th' attempt, and not the deed,\\r\\nConfounds vs: hearke: I lay'd their Daggers
      ready,\\r\\nHe could not misse 'em. Had he not resembled\\r\\nMy Father as he
      slept, I had don't.\\r\\nMy Husband?\\r\\n  Macb. I haue done the deed:\\r\\nDidst
      thou not heare a noyse?\\r\\n  Lady. I heard the Owle schreame, and the Crickets

      i'th' second Chamber?\\r\\n  Lady. Donalbaine\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mac. This is a sorry
      sight\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lady. A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight\\r\\n\\r\\n
      \  Macb. There's one did laugh in's sleepe,\\r\\nAnd one cry'd Murther, that
      they did wake each other:\\r\\nI stood, and heard them: But they did say their
      Prayers,\\r\\nAnd addrest them againe to sleepe\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lady. There are
      two lodg'd together\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. One cry'd God blesse vs, and Amen the
      other,\\r\\nAs they had seene me with these Hangmans hands:\\r\\nListning their
      feare, I could not say Amen,\\r\\nWhen they did say God blesse vs\\r\\n\\r\\n
      \  Lady. Consider it not so deepely\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mac. But wherefore could not
      I pronounce Amen?\\r\\nI had most need of Blessing, and Amen stuck in my throat\\r\\n\\r\\n
      \  Lady. These deeds must not be thought\\r\\nAfter these wayes: so, it will
      make vs mad\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Me thought I heard a voyce cry, Sleep no more:\\r\\nMacbeth
      does murther Sleepe, the innocent Sleepe,\\r\\nSleepe that knits vp the rauel'd
      Sleeue of Care,\\r\\nThe death of each dayes Life, sore Labors Bath,\\r\\nBalme
      of hurt Mindes, great Natures second Course,\\r\\nChiefe nourisher in Life's
      Feast\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lady. What doe you meane?\\r\\n  Macb. Still it cry'd, Sleepe
      no more to all the House:\\r\\nGlamis hath murther'd Sleepe, and therefore Cawdor\\r\\nShall
      sleepe no more: Macbeth shall sleepe no more\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lady. Who was it,
      that thus cry'd? why worthy Thane,\\r\\nYou doe vnbend your Noble strength,
      to thinke\\r\\nSo braine-sickly of things: Goe get some Water,\\r\\nAnd wash
      this filthie Witnesse from your Hand.\\r\\nWhy did you bring these Daggers from
      the place?\\r\\nThey must lye there: goe carry them, and smeare\\r\\nThe sleepie
      Groomes with blood\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Ile goe no more:\\r\\nI am afraid, to
      thinke what I haue done:\\r\\nLooke on't againe, I dare not\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lady.
      Infirme of purpose:\\r\\nGiue me the Daggers: the sleeping, and the dead,\\r\\nAre
      but as Pictures: 'tis the Eye of Childhood,\\r\\nThat feares a painted Deuill.
      If he doe bleed,\\r\\nIle guild the Faces of the Groomes withall,\\r\\nFor it
      must seeme their Guilt.\\r\\nEnter.\\r\\n\\r\\nKnocke within.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Macb.

      Hands are here? hah: they pluck out mine Eyes.\\r\\nWill all great Neptunes
      Ocean wash this blood\\r\\nCleane from my Hand? no: this my Hand will rather\\r\\nThe

      Sleepe, and Vrine.\\r\\nLecherie, Sir, it prouokes, and vnprouokes: it prouokes\\r\\nthe
      desire, but it takes away the performance. Therefore\\r\\nmuch Drinke may be
      said to be an Equiuocator with Lecherie:\\r\\nit makes him, and it marres him;
      it sets him on,\\r\\nand it takes him off; it perswades him, and dis-heartens\\r\\nhim;

      worthy Thane?\\r\\n  Macb. Not yet\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. He did command me to
      call timely on him,\\r\\nI haue almost slipt the houre\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Ile
      bring you to him\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. I know this is a ioyfull trouble to you:\\r\\nBut
      yet 'tis one\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. The labour we delight in, Physicks paine:\\r\\nThis
      is the Doore\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Ile make so bold to call, for 'tis my limitted\\r\\nseruice.\\r\\n\\r\\nExit
      Macduffe.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Lenox. Goes the King hence to day?\\r\\n  Macb. He does:
      he did appoint so\\r\\n\\r\\n   Lenox. The Night ha's been vnruly:\\r\\nWhere
      we lay, our Chimneys were blowne downe,\\r\\nAnd (as they say) lamentings heard
      i'th' Ayre;\\r\\nStrange Schreemes of Death,\\r\\nAnd Prophecying, with Accents
      terrible,\\r\\nOf dyre Combustion, and confus'd Euents,\\r\\nNew hatch'd toth'
      wofull time.\\r\\nThe obscure Bird clamor'd the liue-long Night.\\r\\nSome say,
      the Earth was Feuorous,\\r\\nAnd did shake\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. 'Twas a rough

      the matter?\\r\\n  Macd. Confusion now hath made his Master-peece:\\r\\nMost
      sacrilegious Murther hath broke ope\\r\\nThe Lords anoynted Temple, and stole
      thence\\r\\nThe Life o'th' Building\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. What is't you say, the
      Life?\\r\\n  Lenox. Meane you his Maiestie?\\r\\n  Macd. Approch the Chamber,

      What's the Businesse?\\r\\nThat such a hideous Trumpet calls to parley\\r\\nThe
      sleepers of the House? speake, speake\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. O gentle Lady,\\r\\n'Tis
      not for you to heare what I can speake:\\r\\nThe repetition in a Womans eare,\\r\\nWould

      Had I but dy'd an houre before this chance,\\r\\nI had liu'd a blessed time:
      for from this instant,\\r\\nThere's nothing serious in Mortalitie:\\r\\nAll
      is but Toyes: Renowne and Grace is dead,\\r\\nThe Wine of Life is drawne, and
      the meere Lees\\r\\nIs left this Vault, to brag of.\\r\\nEnter Malcolme and
      Donalbaine.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Donal. What is amisse?\\r\\n  Macb. You are, and doe
      not know't:\\r\\nThe Spring, the Head, the Fountaine of your Blood\\r\\nIs stopt,

      Hands and Faces were all badg'd with blood,\\r\\nSo were their Daggers, which
      vnwip'd, we found\\r\\nVpon their Pillowes: they star'd, and were distracted,\\r\\nNo
      mans Life was to be trusted with them\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. O, yet I doe repent
      me of my furie,\\r\\nThat I did kill them\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Wherefore did
      you so?\\r\\n  Macb. Who can be wise, amaz'd, temp'rate, & furious,\\r\\nLoyall,
      and Neutrall, in a moment? No man:\\r\\nTh' expedition of my violent Loue\\r\\nOut-run
      the pawser, Reason. Here lay Duncan,\\r\\nHis Siluer skinne, lac'd with His
      Golden Blood,\\r\\nAnd his gash'd Stabs, look'd like a Breach in Nature,\\r\\nFor
      Ruines wastfull entrance: there the Murtherers,\\r\\nSteep'd in the Colours
      of their Trade; their Daggers\\r\\nVnmannerly breech'd with gore: who could
      refraine,\\r\\nThat had a heart to loue; and in that heart,\\r\\nCourage, to
      make's loue knowne?\\r\\n  Lady. Helpe me hence, hoa\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Looke
      to the Lady\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. Why doe we hold our tongues,\\r\\nThat most may
      clayme this argument for ours?\\r\\n  Donal. What should be spoken here,\\r\\nWhere
      our Fate hid in an augure hole,\\r\\nMay rush, and seize vs? Let's away,\\r\\nOur
      Teares are not yet brew'd\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. Nor our strong Sorrow\\r\\nVpon

      And so doe I\\r\\n\\r\\n   All. So all\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. Let's briefely put

      predominance, or the Dayes shame,\\r\\nThat Darknesse does the face of Earth
      intombe,\\r\\nWhen liuing Light should kisse it?\\r\\n  Old man. 'Tis vnnaturall,\\r\\nEuen
      like the deed that's done: On Tuesday last,\\r\\nA Faulcon towring in her pride
      of place,\\r\\nWas by a Mowsing Owle hawkt at, and kill'd\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse.
      And Duncans Horses,\\r\\n(A thing most strange, and certaine)\\r\\nBeauteous,
      and swift, the Minions of their Race,\\r\\nTurn'd wilde in nature, broke their
      stalls, flong out,\\r\\nContending 'gainst Obedience, as they would\\r\\nMake

      Sir, now?\\r\\n  Macd. Why see you not?\\r\\n  Ross. Is't known who did this
      more then bloody deed?\\r\\n  Macd. Those that Macbeth hath slaine\\r\\n\\r\\n

      were subborned,\\r\\nMalcolme, and Donalbaine the Kings two Sonnes\\r\\nAre
      stolne away and fled, which puts vpon them\\r\\nSuspition of the deed\\r\\n\\r\\n

      yet it was saide\\r\\nIt should not stand in thy Posterity,\\r\\nBut that my
      selfe should be the Roote, and Father\\r\\nOf many Kings. If there come truth
      from them,\\r\\nAs vpon thee Macbeth, their Speeches shine,\\r\\nWhy by the

      become\\r\\nA womans story, at a Winters fire\\r\\nAuthoriz'd by her Grandam:
      shame it selfe,\\r\\nWhy do you make such faces? When all's done\\r\\nYou looke

      owe,\\r\\nWhen now I thinke you can behold such sights,\\r\\nAnd keepe the naturall
      Rubie of your Cheekes,\\r\\nWhen mine is blanch'd with feare\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse.
      What sights, my Lord?\\r\\n  La. I pray you speake not: he growes worse & worse\\r\\nQuestion

      Speeches,\\r\\nHaue but hit your Thoughts\\r\\nWhich can interpret farther:
      Onely I say\\r\\nThings haue bin strangely borne. The gracious Duncan\\r\\nWas
      pittied of Macbeth: marry he was dead:\\r\\nAnd the right valiant Banquo walk'd
      too late,\\r\\nWhom you may say (if't please you) Fleans kill'd,\\r\\nFor Fleans
      fled: Men must not walke too late.\\r\\nWho cannot want the thought, how monstrous\\r\\nIt
      was for Malcolme, and for Donalbane\\r\\nTo kill their gracious Father? Damned
      Fact,\\r\\nHow it did greeue Macbeth? Did he not straight\\r\\nIn pious rage,
      the two delinquents teare,\\r\\nThat were the Slaues of drinke, and thralles
      of sleepe?\\r\\nWas not that Nobly done? I, and wisely too:\\r\\nFor 'twould
      haue anger'd any heart aliue\\r\\nTo heare the men deny't. So that I say,\\r\\nHe
      ha's borne all things well, and I do thinke,\\r\\nThat had he Duncans Sonnes
      vnder his Key,\\r\\n(As, and't please Heauen he shall not) they should finde\\r\\nWhat
      'twere to kill a Father: So should Fleans.\\r\\nBut peace; for from broad words,

      grace,\\r\\nThat the maleuolence of Fortune, nothing\\r\\nTakes from his high

      I may tell pale-hearted Feare, it lies;\\r\\nAnd sleepe in spight of Thunder.\\r\\n\\r\\nThunder
      3 Apparation, a Childe Crowned, with a Tree in his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is
      this, that rises like the issue of a King,\\r\\nAnd weares vpon his Baby-brow,
      the round\\r\\nAnd top of Soueraignty?\\r\\n  All. Listen, but speake not too't\\r\\n\\r\\n
      \  3 Appar. Be Lyon metled, proud, and take no care:\\r\\nWho chafes, who frets,
      or where Conspirers are:\\r\\nMacbeth shall neuer vanquish'd be, vntill\\r\\nGreat
      Byrnam Wood, to high Dunsmane Hill\\r\\nShall come against him.\\r\\n\\r\\nDescend.\\r\\n\\r\\n
      \ Macb. That will neuer bee:\\r\\nWho can impresse the Forrest, bid the Tree\\r\\nVnfixe
      his earth-bound Root? Sweet boadments, good:\\r\\nRebellious dead, rise neuer
      till the Wood\\r\\nOf Byrnan rise, and our high plac'd Macbeth\\r\\nShall liue
      the Lease of Nature, pay his breath\\r\\nTo time, and mortall Custome. Yet my
      Hart\\r\\nThrobs to know one thing: Tell me, if your Art\\r\\nCan tell so much:
      Shall Banquo's issue euer\\r\\nReigne in this Kingdome?\\r\\n  All. Seeke to
      know no more\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macb. I will be satisfied. Deny me this,\\r\\nAnd

      Down:\\r\\nThy Crowne do's seare mine Eye-bals. And thy haire\\r\\nThou other
      Gold-bound-brow, is like the first:\\r\\nA third, is like the former. Filthy

      the Line stretch out to'th' cracke of Doome?\\r\\nAnother yet? A seauenth? Ile
      see no more:\\r\\nAnd yet the eighth appeares, who beares a glasse,\\r\\nWhich
      shewes me many more: and some I see,\\r\\nThat two-fold Balles, and trebble
      Scepters carry.\\r\\nHorrible sight: Now I see 'tis true,\\r\\nFor the Blood-bolter'd
      Banquo smiles vpon me,\\r\\nAnd points at them for his. What? is this so?\\r\\n
      \ 1 I Sir, all this is so. But why\\r\\nStands Macbeth thus amazedly?\\r\\nCome

      shall be\\r\\nThe firstlings of my hand. And euen now\\r\\nTo Crown my thoughts
      with Acts: be it thoght & done:\\r\\nThe Castle of Macduff, I will surprize.\\r\\nSeize
      vpon Fife; giue to th' edge o'th' Sword\\r\\nHis Wife, his Babes, and all vnfortunate
      Soules\\r\\nThat trace him in his Line. No boasting like a Foole,\\r\\nThis
      deed Ile do, before this purpose coole,\\r\\nBut no more sights. Where are these
      Gentlemen?\\r\\nCome bring me where they are.\\r\\n\\r\\nExeunt.\\r\\n\\r\\nScena
      Secunda.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter Macduffes Wife, her Son, and Rosse.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Wife.
      What had he done, to make him fly the Land?\\r\\n  Rosse. You must haue patience
      Madam\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. He had none:\\r\\nHis flight was madnesse: when our
      Actions do not,\\r\\nOur feares do make vs Traitors\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. You
      know not\\r\\nWhether it was his wisedome, or his feare\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife.
      Wisedom? to leaue his wife, to leaue his Babes,\\r\\nHis Mansion, and his Titles,
      in a place\\r\\nFrom whence himselfe do's flye? He loues vs not,\\r\\nHe wants
      the naturall touch. For the poore Wren\\r\\n(The most diminitiue of Birds) will
      fight,\\r\\nHer yong ones in her Nest, against the Owle:\\r\\nAll is the Feare,
      and nothing is the Loue;\\r\\nAs little is the Wisedome, where the flight\\r\\nSo
      runnes against all reason\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. My deerest Cooz,\\r\\nI pray
      you schoole your selfe. But for your Husband,\\r\\nHe is Noble, Wise, Iudicious,
      and best knowes\\r\\nThe fits o'th' Season. I dare not speake much further,\\r\\nBut
      cruell are the times, when we are Traitors\\r\\nAnd do not know our selues:
      when we hold Rumor\\r\\nFrom what we feare, yet know not what we feare,\\r\\nBut
      floate vpon a wilde and violent Sea\\r\\nEach way, and moue. I take my leaue
      of you:\\r\\nShall not be long but Ile be heere againe:\\r\\nThings at the worst
      will cease, or else climbe vpward,\\r\\nTo what they were before. My pretty
      Cosine,\\r\\nBlessing vpon you\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. Father'd he is,\\r\\nAnd
      yet hee's Father-lesse\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. I am so much a Foole, should I stay
      longer\\r\\nIt would be my disgrace, and your discomfort.\\r\\nI take my leaue
      at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nExit Rosse.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Wife. Sirra, your Fathers dead,\\r\\nAnd
      what will you do now? How will you liue?\\r\\n  Son. As Birds do Mother\\r\\n\\r\\n
      \  Wife. What with Wormes, and Flyes?\\r\\n  Son. With what I get I meane, and
      so do they\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. Poore Bird,\\r\\nThou'dst neuer Feare the Net,
      nor Lime,\\r\\nThe Pitfall, nor the Gin\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. Why should I Mother?\\r\\nPoore
      Birds they are not set for:\\r\\nMy Father is not dead for all your saying\\r\\n\\r\\n
      \  Wife. Yes, he is dead:\\r\\nHow wilt thou do for a Father?\\r\\n  Son. Nay
      how will you do for a Husband?\\r\\n  Wife. Why I can buy me twenty at any Market\\r\\n\\r\\n
      \  Son. Then you'l by 'em to sell againe\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. Thou speak'st withall
      thy wit,\\r\\nAnd yet I'faith with wit enough for thee\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. Was
      my Father a Traitor, Mother?\\r\\n  Wife. I, that he was\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son.
      What is a Traitor?\\r\\n  Wife. Why one that sweares, and lyes\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son.
      And be all Traitors, that do so\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. Euery one that do's so,
      is a Traitor,\\r\\nAnd must be hang'd\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. And must they all be
      hang'd, that swear and lye?\\r\\n  Wife. Euery one\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. Who must
      hang them?\\r\\n  Wife. Why, the honest men\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. Then the Liars
      and Swearers are Fools: for there\\r\\nare Lyars and Swearers enow, to beate
      the honest men,\\r\\nand hang vp them\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. Now God helpe thee,
      poore Monkie:\\r\\nBut how wilt thou do for a Father?\\r\\n  Son. If he were
      dead, youl'd weepe for him: if you\\r\\nwould not, it were a good signe, that
      I should quickely\\r\\nhaue a new Father\\r\\n\\r\\n   Wife. Poore pratler,
      how thou talk'st?\\r\\nEnter a Messenger.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mes. Blesse you faire
      Dame: I am not to you known,\\r\\nThough in your state of Honor I am perfect;\\r\\nI
      doubt some danger do's approach you neerely.\\r\\nIf you will take a homely
      mans aduice,\\r\\nBe not found heere: Hence with your little ones\\r\\nTo fright
      you thus. Me thinkes I am too sauage:\\r\\nTo do worse to you, were fell Cruelty,\\r\\nWhich
      is too nie your person. Heauen preserue you,\\r\\nI dare abide no longer.\\r\\n\\r\\nExit
      Messenger\\r\\n\\r\\n  Wife. Whether should I flye?\\r\\nI haue done no harme.
      But I remember now\\r\\nI am in this earthly world: where to do harme\\r\\nIs
      often laudable, to do good sometime\\r\\nAccounted dangerous folly. Why then
      (alas)\\r\\nDo I put vp that womanly defence,\\r\\nTo say I haue done no harme?\\r\\nWhat
      are these faces?\\r\\nEnter Murtherers.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mur. Where is your Husband?\\r\\n
      \ Wife. I hope in no place so vnsanctified,\\r\\nWhere such as thou may'st finde
      him\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mur. He's a Traitor\\r\\n\\r\\n   Son. Thou ly'st thou shagge-ear'd
      Villaine\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mur. What you Egge?\\r\\nYong fry of Treachery?\\r\\n
      \ Son. He ha's kill'd me Mother,\\r\\nRun away I pray you.\\r\\n\\r\\nExit crying
      Murther.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nScaena Tertia.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnter Malcolme and Macduffe.\\r\\n\\r\\n
      \ Mal. Let vs seeke out some desolate shade, & there\\r\\nWeepe our sad bosomes
      empty\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Let vs rather\\r\\nHold fast the mortall Sword: and
      like good men,\\r\\nBestride our downfall Birthdome: each new Morne,\\r\\nNew
      Widdowes howle, new Orphans cry, new sorowes\\r\\nStrike heauen on the face,
      that it resounds\\r\\nAs if it felt with Scotland, and yell'd out\\r\\nLike
      Syllable of Dolour\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. What I beleeue, Ile waile;\\r\\nWhat know,
      beleeue; and what I can redresse,\\r\\nAs I shall finde the time to friend:
      I wil.\\r\\nWhat you haue spoke, it may be so perchance.\\r\\nThis Tyrant, whose
      sole name blisters our tongues,\\r\\nWas once thought honest: you haue lou'd
      him well,\\r\\nHe hath not touch'd you yet. I am yong, but something\\r\\nYou
      may discerne of him through me, and wisedome\\r\\nTo offer vp a weake, poore
      innocent Lambe\\r\\nT' appease an angry God\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. I am not treacherous\\r\\n\\r\\n
      \  Malc. But Macbeth is.\\r\\nA good and vertuous Nature may recoyle\\r\\nIn
      an Imperiall charge. But I shall craue your pardon:\\r\\nThat which you are,
      my thoughts cannot transpose;\\r\\nAngels are bright still, though the brightest
      fell.\\r\\nThough all things foule, would wear the brows of grace\\r\\nYet Grace
      must still looke so\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. I haue lost my Hopes\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc.
      Perchance euen there\\r\\nWhere I did finde my doubts.\\r\\nWhy in that rawnesse
      left you Wife, and Childe?\\r\\nThose precious Motiues, those strong knots of
      Loue,\\r\\nWithout leaue-taking. I pray you,\\r\\nLet not my Iealousies, be
      your Dishonors,\\r\\nBut mine owne Safeties: you may be rightly iust,\\r\\nWhat
      euer I shall thinke\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Bleed, bleed poore Country,\\r\\nGreat
      Tyrrany, lay thou thy basis sure,\\r\\nFor goodnesse dare not check thee: wear
      y thy wrongs,\\r\\nThe Title, is affear'd. Far thee well Lord,\\r\\nI would
      not be the Villaine that thou think'st,\\r\\nFor the whole Space that's in the
      Tyrants Graspe,\\r\\nAnd the rich East to boot\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. Be not offended:\\r\\nI
      speake not as in absolute feare of you:\\r\\nI thinke our Country sinkes beneath
      the yoake,\\r\\nIt weepes, it bleeds, and each new day a gash\\r\\nIs added
      to her wounds. I thinke withall,\\r\\nThere would be hands vplifted in my right:\\r\\nAnd
      heere from gracious England haue I offer\\r\\nOf goodly thousands. But for all
      this,\\r\\nWhen I shall treade vpon the Tyrants head,\\r\\nOr weare it on my
      Sword; yet my poore Country\\r\\nShall haue more vices then it had before,\\r\\nMore
      suffer, and more sundry wayes then euer,\\r\\nBy him that shall succeede\\r\\n\\r\\n
      \  Macd. What should he be?\\r\\n  Mal. It is my selfe I meane: in whom I know\\r\\nAll
      the particulars of Vice so grafted,\\r\\nThat when they shall be open'd, blacke
      Macbeth\\r\\nWill seeme as pure as Snow, and the poore State\\r\\nEsteeme him
      as a Lambe, being compar'd\\r\\nWith my confinelesse harmes\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd.
      Not in the Legions\\r\\nOf horrid Hell, can come a Diuell more damn'd\\r\\nIn
      euils, to top Macbeth\\r\\n\\r\\n   Mal. I grant him Bloody,\\r\\nLuxurious,
      Auaricious, False, Deceitfull,\\r\\nSodaine, Malicious, smacking of euery sinne\\r\\nThat
      ha's a name. But there's no bottome, none\\r\\nIn my Voluptuousnesse: Your Wiues,
      your Daughters,\\r\\nYour Matrons, and your Maides, could not fill vp\\r\\nThe
      Cesterne of my Lust, and my Desire\\r\\nAll continent Impediments would ore-beare\\r\\nThat
      did oppose my will. Better Macbeth,\\r\\nThen such an one to reigne\\r\\n\\r\\n
      \  Macd. Boundlesse intemperance\\r\\nIn Nature is a Tyranny: It hath beene\\r\\nTh'
      vntimely emptying of the happy Throne,\\r\\nAnd fall of many Kings. But feare
      not yet\\r\\nTo take vpon you what is yours: you may\\r\\nConuey your pleasures
      in a spacious plenty,\\r\\nAnd yet seeme cold. The time you may so hoodwinke:\\r\\nWe
      haue willing Dames enough: there cannot be\\r\\nThat Vulture in you, to deuoure
      so many\\r\\nAs will to Greatnesse dedicate themselues,\\r\\nFinding it so inclinde\\r\\n\\r\\n
      \  Mal. With this, there growes\\r\\nIn my most ill-composd Affection, such\\r\\nA
      stanchlesse Auarice, that were I King,\\r\\nI should cut off the Nobles for
      their Lands,\\r\\nDesire his Iewels, and this others House,\\r\\nAnd my more-hauing,
      would be as a Sawce\\r\\nTo make me hunger more, that I should forge\\r\\nQuarrels
      vniust against the Good and Loyall,\\r\\nDestroying them for wealth\\r\\n\\r\\n
      \  Macd. This Auarice\\r\\nstickes deeper: growes with more pernicious roote\\r\\nThen
      Summer-seeming Lust: and it hath bin\\r\\nThe Sword of our slaine Kings: yet
      do not feare,\\r\\nScotland hath Foysons, to fill vp your will\\r\\nOf your
      meere Owne. All these are portable,\\r\\nWith other Graces weigh'd\\r\\n\\r\\n
      \  Mal. But I haue none. The King-becoming Graces,\\r\\nAs Iustice, Verity,
      Temp'rance, Stablenesse,\\r\\nBounty, Perseuerance, Mercy, Lowlinesse,\\r\\nDeuotion,
      Patience, Courage, Fortitude,\\r\\nI haue no rellish of them, but abound\\r\\nIn
      the diuision of each seuerall Crime,\\r\\nActing it many wayes. Nay, had I powre,
      I should\\r\\nPoure the sweet Milke of Concord, into Hell,\\r\\nVprore the vniuersall
      peace, confound\\r\\nAll vnity on earth\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. O Scotland, Scotland\\r\\n\\r\\n
      \  Mal. If such a one be fit to gouerne, speake:\\r\\nI am as I haue spoken\\r\\n\\r\\n
      \  Mac. Fit to gouern? No not to liue. O Natio[n] miserable!\\r\\nWith an vntitled
      Tyrant, bloody Sceptred,\\r\\nWhen shalt thou see thy wholsome dayes againe?\\r\\nSince
      that the truest Issue of thy Throne\\r\\nBy his owne Interdiction stands accust,\\r\\nAnd
      do's blaspheme his breed? Thy Royall Father\\r\\nWas a most Sainted-King: the
      Queene that bore thee,\\r\\nOftner vpon her knees, then on her feet,\\r\\nDy'de
      euery day she liu'd. Fare thee well,\\r\\nThese Euils thou repeat'st vpon thy
      selfe,\\r\\nHath banish'd me from Scotland. O my Brest,\\r\\nThy hope ends heere\\r\\n\\r\\n
      \  Mal. Macduff, this Noble passion\\r\\nChilde of integrity, hath from my soule\\r\\nWip'd
      the blacke Scruples, reconcil'd my thoughts\\r\\nTo thy good Truth, and Honor.
      Diuellish Macbeth,\\r\\nBy many of these traines, hath sought to win me\\r\\nInto
      his power: and modest Wisedome pluckes me\\r\\nFrom ouer-credulous hast: but
      God aboue\\r\\nDeale betweene thee and me; For euen now\\r\\nI put my selfe
      to thy Direction, and\\r\\nVnspeake mine owne detraction. Heere abiure\\r\\nThe
      taints, and blames I laide vpon my selfe,\\r\\nFor strangers to my Nature. I
      am yet\\r\\nVnknowne to Woman, neuer was forsworne,\\r\\nScarsely haue coueted
      what was mine owne.\\r\\nAt no time broke my Faith, would not betray\\r\\nThe
      Deuill to his Fellow, and delight\\r\\nNo lesse in truth then life. My first
      false speaking\\r\\nWas this vpon my selfe. What I am truly\\r\\nIs thine, and
      my poore Countries to command:\\r\\nWhither indeed, before they heere approach\\r\\nOld
      Seyward with ten thousand warlike men\\r\\nAlready at a point, was setting foorth:\\r\\nNow
      wee'l together, and the chance of goodnesse\\r\\nBe like our warranted Quarrell.
      Why are you silent?\\r\\n  Macd. Such welcome, and vnwelcom things at once\\r\\n'Tis
      hard to reconcile.\\r\\nEnter a Doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mal. Well, more anon. Comes
      the King forth\\r\\nI pray you?\\r\\n  Doct. I Sir: there are a crew of wretched
      Soules\\r\\nThat stay his Cure: their malady conuinces\\r\\nThe great assay
      of Art. But at his touch,\\r\\nSuch sanctity hath Heauen giuen his hand,\\r\\nThey
      presently amend.\\r\\nEnter.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Mal. I thanke you Doctor\\r\\n\\r\\n
      \  Macd. What's the Disease he meanes?\\r\\n  Mal. Tis call'd the Euill.\\r\\nA
      most myraculous worke in this good King,\\r\\nWhich often since my heere remaine
      in England,\\r\\nI haue seene him do: How he solicites heauen\\r\\nHimselfe
      best knowes: but strangely visited people\\r\\nAll swolne and Vlcerous, pittifull
      to the eye,\\r\\nThe meere dispaire of Surgery, he cures,\\r\\nHanging a golden
      stampe about their neckes,\\r\\nPut on with holy Prayers, and 'tis spoken\\r\\nTo
      the succeeding Royalty he leaues\\r\\nThe healing Benediction. With this strange
      vertue,\\r\\nHe hath a heauenly guift of Prophesie,\\r\\nAnd sundry Blessings
      hang about his Throne,\\r\\nThat speake him full of Grace.\\r\\nEnter Rosse.\\r\\n\\r\\n
      \ Macd. See who comes heere\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. My Countryman: but yet I know
      him not\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. My euer gentle Cozen, welcome hither\\r\\n\\r\\n
      \  Malc. I know him now. Good God betimes remoue\\r\\nThe meanes that makes
      vs Strangers\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. Sir, Amen\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Stands Scotland
      where it did?\\r\\n  Rosse. Alas poore Countrey,\\r\\nAlmost affraid to know
      it selfe. It cannot\\r\\nBe call'd our Mother, but our Graue; where nothing\\r\\nBut
      who knowes nothing, is once seene to smile:\\r\\nWhere sighes, and groanes,
      and shrieks that rent the ayre\\r\\nAre made, not mark'd: Where violent sorrow
      seemes\\r\\nA Moderne extasie: The Deadmans knell,\\r\\nIs there scarse ask'd
      for who, and good mens liues\\r\\nExpire before the Flowers in their Caps,\\r\\nDying,
      or ere they sicken\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. Oh Relation; too nice, and yet too true\\r\\n\\r\\n
      \  Malc. What's the newest griefe?\\r\\n  Rosse. That of an houres age, doth
      hisse the speaker,\\r\\nEach minute teemes a new one\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. How
      do's my Wife?\\r\\n  Rosse. Why well\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. And all my Children?\\r\\n
      \ Rosse. Well too\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. The Tyrant ha's not batter'd at their
      peace?\\r\\n  Rosse. No, they were wel at peace, when I did leaue 'em\\r\\n
      \ Macd. Be not a niggard of your speech: How gos't?\\r\\n  Rosse. When I came
      hither to transport the Tydings\\r\\nWhich I haue heauily borne, there ran a
      Rumour\\r\\nOf many worthy Fellowes, that were out,\\r\\nWhich was to my beleefe
      witnest the rather,\\r\\nFor that I saw the Tyrants Power a-foot.\\r\\nNow is
      the time of helpe: your eye in Scotland\\r\\nWould create Soldiours, make our
      women fight,\\r\\nTo doffe their dire distresses\\r\\n\\r\\n   Malc. Bee't their
      comfort\\r\\nWe are comming thither: Gracious England hath\\r\\nLent vs good
      Seyward, and ten thousand men,\\r\\nAn older, and a better Souldier, none\\r\\nThat
      Christendome giues out\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rosse. Would I could answer\\r\\nThis comfort
      with the like. But I haue words\\r\\nThat would be howl'd out in the desert
      ayre,\\r\\nWhere hearing should not latch them\\r\\n\\r\\n   Macd. What concerne
